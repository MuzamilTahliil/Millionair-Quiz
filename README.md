## Sounds

The application uses sounds for different actions such as correct and wrong answers, and a start sound when the quiz begins. Make sure to add your sound files in the appropriate directory and import them in your components.

## Important Note

The "Let's Start" button on the Home Page is crucial as it navigates to the quiz page. Ensure it functions correctly by checking the `startQuiz` function in the `Home.jsx` component.

```javascript
const startQuiz = () => {
  navigate('/quiz');
};
```
```
